# Developer Action Plan: WhatsApp to Telegram AI Property Tracker

Phase 1: System Setup & Preparation

1.1 Define Project Scope & Goals

The system will listen to WhatsApp group messages, extract real estate listings, store them in Google Sheets, and provide an AI-powered Telegram bot interface for interaction.

The AI will process user requests to query, update, and manage property listings in Google Sheets.

1.2 Setup & API Access

Google Sheets API: Enable API access and generate credentials for read/write operations.

Telegram Bot API: Register the bot with BotFather and retrieve the API token.

OpenAI API: Set up an account and generate an API key for text processing.

WhatsApp Automation: Choose between:

Unofficial APIs (e.g., Chat-API, go-whatsapp) – easier setup but risk of bans.

Web Automation (Selenium/Puppeteer) – requires maintaining an active session.

WhatsApp Business API – official but costly and complex.

1.3 Choose Hosting Environment
current version will run on local machine.

Phase 2: WhatsApp Message Capture & Processing

2.1 Implement WhatsApp Listener

Connect to WhatsApp groups and listen for new messages.

Extract structured property details from messages (address, price, contact info, etc.).

Filter out duplicate listings, updating prices if necessary.

Store extracted data in Google Sheets.

2.2 AI Processing for Data Extraction

Use OpenAI API to interpret unstructured messages and extract structured data.

If information is missing (e.g., city name), attempt to infer from context.

Log processed messages and track updates in a comments column.

Phase 3: Google Sheets Data Management

3.1 Define Google Sheets Structure

Columns:

Asset ID (Unique)

Date/Time Captured

Group Source (WhatsApp Group Name)

Title/Short Description

City

Address

Price

Currency

Phone Number

Username

Property Type

Status (Active/Sold/Pending)

Date Sold

Message Link/ID

Notes (Property details, rooms, etc.)

Comments (Internal tracking: updates, changes, etc.)

3.2 Implement Data Storage Logic

Ensure all incoming WhatsApp messages are structured before insertion.

Prevent duplicate properties (match based on address, contact, and description).

Update prices instead of creating duplicates.

Allow AI to dynamically add columns when prompted by the user.

Phase 4: Telegram Bot Development

4.1 Setup Telegram Bot

Configure the bot to handle incoming messages.

Implement basic command processing (e.g., /start, /help).

4.2 AI-Powered Query Handling

Integrate OpenAI API to understand natural language queries.

Allow the bot to:

Query Google Sheets (e.g., "Show me properties in Tel Aviv under $500K").

Update property statuses (e.g., "Mark the 3-room apartment in Haifa as sold").

Add new columns dynamically and attempt to backfill missing data.

4.3 Implement Google Sheets API Integration

Fetch and display property data based on user queries.

Update Google Sheets when users request modifications.

Ensure secure read/write operations.

Phase 5: Error Handling & Optimization

5.1 Implement Logging & Error Handling

Log all WhatsApp message processing failures.

Handle API failures (Google Sheets, OpenAI, Telegram) with retry mechanisms.

Ensure the bot prompts for clarification if the AI cannot confidently process a request.

5.2 Security & Permissions

Ensure Google Sheets API access is restricted to authorized users.

Protect Telegram bot API token from exposure.

Use secure authentication for any cloud-based backend services.

Phase 6: Deployment & Testing

6.1 Deployment Strategy

Deploy the Telegram bot and WhatsApp listener as separate services.

Configure webhook-based updates where applicable.

Set up cron jobs or event-driven triggers for scheduled processing.

6.2 Testing

Unit Tests: Ensure AI correctly extracts property details from messages.

Integration Tests: Verify seamless data flow from WhatsApp to Google Sheets to Telegram.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensure real-world usability of the system.

Phase 7: Future Enhancements & Scalability

7.1 Potential Upgrades

Move from Google Sheets to a database (Firebase/PostgreSQL) for better performance.

Enable voice-based commands in Telegram.

Implement advanced filtering (e.g., alerts when new properties match user preferences).

7.2 Maintenance Plan

Monitor API rate limits and usage costs.

Regularly update AI processing logic for better message extraction.

Ensure uptime of WhatsApp listener service.

Final Notes

Developer should focus on modular implementation, ensuring each component (WhatsApp listener, AI processing, Google Sheets integration, Telegram bot) works independently.

Error handling is critical, especially for WhatsApp automation.

User experience should be simple and conversational via Telegram.

Next Steps:

Review and refine this plan.

Identify potential technical constraints.

Begin implementation phase-by-phase.
