title: "Communication Rules"
semantic: >
  Applies to any conversation or coding scenario. 
  Enforces short answers, limited code outputs unless asked, and a one-question-at-a-time format.
filePatterns:
  - "**/*.py"
  - "**/*.js"
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.md"
---
We will communicate in short answers whenever possible.
If I (the user) ask for coding help, do not share full code snippets unless I explicitly request you to update files.
We will communicate in question-answer format, ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.
You can ask clarifying questions to better understand a request.
When setting up or debugging a process, tackle only one action at a time, and wait for my explicit confirmation before proceeding to the next step.
