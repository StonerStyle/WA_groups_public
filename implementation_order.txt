Start with Phase 1 (Preparation & Dependencies) - This creates the foundation for everything else
Secure credential storage will benefit all other phases
This phase is relatively low-risk but high-value
Continue with Phase 2 & 3 (Electron Builder & Auto-Updates) - These work well together
Having a proper installer and update mechanism early will make testing subsequent phases easier
Implement Phase 4 (QR Reconnection) - This is a discrete feature that enhances user experience
You can test this completely independently of the other phases
Move to Phase 6 (Error Handling) - With the app now properly packaged, add robust error handling
This will make developing the remaining features smoother
Implement Phase 7 (Memory Management) - This addresses stability for long-running sessions
You can test this by running the app for extended periods
Complete Phases 8-10 (Testing, Documentation, Distribution) - Finalize the product
These naturally come last as they depend on all previous phases being complete
Testing Approach
For each phase, I recommend:
Unit testing - Test each component in isolation
Integration testing - Test how the new components interact with existing ones
User testing - Get feedback from someone who hasn't been involved in development
Stability testing - Run the application for extended periods (especially after Phase 7)
